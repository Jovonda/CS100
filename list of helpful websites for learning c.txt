https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJgsSFOSQv0 - Tutorial for Beginners, goes over some of what we did in class

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NWeucMKrLI&list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGAKIXv8Yr6nhGJ9Vlcjyymq - Also really good tutorial for learing c

https://www.codewars.com/ - Good for when you got the hang of c, have to pass a test to sign up first, use for practicing code

https://www.hackerrank.com/ - Good for practicing code

https://www.codingame.com/- Good for challenging other people in coding

For the Labs, quizzes, and tracing, try to do them without looking at the answers first.

A good tool to use for coding is to use ATOM, it is a text editor and it is really helpful, it helped me pass my class. Even though the basics might say to use VIM, it is best to go online and download ATOM.

*Since ATOM has now shutdown, it is usually best to use Visual Studio Code instead, or you can try to use Pulsar which is the "successor" to atom
