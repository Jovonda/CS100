# CS100

## Note
I did ask a former professor for permission to post my code from this class on here since I have already graduated.
I , however, was told not to use some prompts which were lecture promts or for projects.
There are comments in the project code giving a brief introduction about what the program does, but pdfs for the senarios are not included.
There are past quizzes, exams, and past final exams from 2017 and 2018 that are fine, because they do not have any disclaimer on them. 

### Overall Description
This is a whole cumulation of everything I have done in CS100 for the Spring semester of 2019.
I have done everything here using Cygwin, but now I am using Mingw as of now. Both
are help with running C, I just wanted to try something new with Mingw.

## Lectures
These are all the lectures I went through in class and I did step by step with the teacher.
As in the top note, there are no lecture documents here, just my code I used for practice.

## Labs
These are all the labs I did along with my answers to them, for personal practice it is better
to try these yourself and then look at answer later. The labs were some times during a 1 hour period and 
had to be turned in that same day. Sometimes if people had issues with the lab or still did not understand some
things, the teacher would allow us to turn in labs at a later time.

## Projects
These are all the projects I have done, as a forwarning, project 3 needs to be redone.
I had issues with understanding it in the past and I will have to improve on it at a
later time. These projects are "small" and some students were given about 2 weeks to finish.
As in the top note, there are no project pdf documents here, just my code I used for practice.


## Quizzes
The quizzes are just practice quizzes from fall and spring 2017 and 2018. There are pdf files for each
giving the senario and how to run them. Each quiz is just tracing but with I went through each of them with what I expeced the output to be
versus what the actual output is. Each practice quiz I would do on paper before running
the code. The comments at the bottom of each quiz is what I did by hand and got on my own
(expected) versus what the output is when I ran the code (actual).

## Exams
The exams are just practice exams from fall and spring 2017 and 2018. The exams were separated
into tracing and coding parts. There are pdfs in each part explaning what is going.
I have answers to both in each part. For personal practice, try to time yourself. The exams were an hour and
15 minutes. From what I remember tracing was only for 25 minutes while the rest of the time was for 
the coding part.

## Final Exams
The final exams are just pracitice final exams from fall and spring 2017 and 2018. There are pdfs for these just like the regular exams.
Also just like the regular exams these are also separated into tracing and coding parts. I also have answers for both parts. The final exams 
where given a much longer time period of 2 hrs. From what I remember it was 30 minutes for tracing while the rest was for the coding part.

## Extras
I also have a list of helpful websites and some youtube videos that give a really good explanation of C that will not leave you stuck in tutorials. 
I will often comeback and update this list when I bump into something useful.
